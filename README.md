## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher recommended)
-   `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` package manager

### 1. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/udaykrizzz19/Tool-Kit-Pro
    cd toolkitpro
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

### 2. Set up Supabase

This project requires a Supabase backend for database, authentication, and storage.

1.  **Create a Supabase Project**: Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com), sign in, and create a new project.

2.  **Database Schema**: Navigate to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase project dashboard and run the following SQL queries to set up the necessary tables and functions.

    ```sql
    -- 1. Create the profiles table to store public user data
    CREATE TABLE profiles (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      full_name TEXT,
      purpose TEXT,
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
    );
    COMMENT ON TABLE public.profiles IS 'Stores public user data linked to authentication.';

    -- 2. Create the categories table
    CREATE TABLE categories (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
      user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      name TEXT NOT NULL,
      color TEXT, -- Kept in schema for future extensibility
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
    );
    COMMENT ON TABLE public.categories IS 'Stores user-defined categories for organizing tools.';

    -- 3. Create the tools table
    CREATE TABLE tools (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
      user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      name TEXT NOT NULL,
      link TEXT NOT NULL,
      description TEXT,
      category_id UUID REFERENCES categories(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
      tags TEXT[],
      notes TEXT,
      is_pinned BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
    );
    COMMENT ON TABLE public.tools IS 'Stores the core tool/resource data for each user.';


    -- 4. Function to automatically create a profile when a new user signs up
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
    RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
    BEGIN
      INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, full_name, purpose)
      VALUES (new.id, new.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', new.raw_user_meta_data->>'purpose');
      RETURN new;
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
    COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.handle_new_user() IS 'Automatically creates a profile for a new user.';

    -- 5. Trigger to execute the function on new user creation
    CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
      AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
      FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
    ```

3.  **Row Level Security (RLS)**: For data privacy and security, you must enable RLS and create policies. Run this SQL in the editor:

    ```sql
    -- Enable RLS for all relevant tables
    ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    ALTER TABLE categories ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    ALTER TABLE tools ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

    -- Create policies for the 'profiles' table
    CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile." ON profiles FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
    CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile." ON profiles FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

    -- Create policies for the 'categories' table
    -- This single policy allows full management (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) for the owner.
    CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own categories." ON categories FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

    -- Create policies for the 'tools' table
    -- This single policy allows full management for the owner.
    CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own tools." ON tools FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
    ```

### 3. Environment Variables

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of your project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  Go to your Supabase project's **Settings > API**.
3.  Copy the **Project URL** and the **`anon` (public) key**.
4.  Add them to your `.env` file:

    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    ```

### 4. Running the Application

Now you can start the local development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## üé® Theming & Customization

The application uses a CSS variable-based theming system, making it easy to customize the look and feel.

-   **Theme Definition**: All theme colors are defined in `src/styles/globals.css`.
-   **Light & Dark Modes**: Colors for light mode are defined under the `:root` selector, and colors for dark mode are under the `.dark` selector.
-   **Accent Colors**: The primary theme is black and white for focus. Specific accent colors are defined for user feedback:
    -   `--destructive` & `--destructive-foreground` for delete/danger actions (Red).
    -   `--success` & `--success-foreground` for confirmation/success actions (Green).
-   **Component Styling**: Most UI components from `shadcn/ui` are styled using these CSS variables and will adapt automatically to any theme changes you make.
